Flask Weather App using OpenWeatherMap API

This project is a fully functional Flask-based Weather Application that retrieves real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It features a clean and responsive frontend built with HTML and CSS, while the backend is powered by Python and Flask, enabling seamless API communication and rendering dynamic results. The application allows users to search for weather details by entering a city and optional country code (e.g., “Bengaluru,IN”), and instantly displays temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more. Along with the main web interface, the project also includes a CLI weather tool (weather_cli.py) and an API test script (test_request.py) to verify API keys and ensure proper functionality. Environment variables are managed through a .env file to securely store API keys, and dependencies are listed in requirements.txt for easy setup. The project structure is clean and organized, containing dedicated folders for templates and static assets. To run the app, users simply install the requirements, add their API key, and launch the Flask server. This project showcases strong skills in Python, Flask, APIs, environment handling, and full-stack development, making it suitable for deployment and an excellent addition to a professional portfolio.
